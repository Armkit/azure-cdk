## Summary

`Armkit`, **Azure Cloud Development Kit (CDK),** is an open source software development framework to define cloud Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and provision it through `Azure ARM Templates`.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define `Azure` resources imperatively using the power of modern programming languages. Using the `Armkit` library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate Azure best practices in your infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

`Armkit` is available in the following languages:

- JavaScript/TypeScript ([Node.js â‰¥ 12.17.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v12.x/))

## Background

Developers use the `Armkit` framework in one of the supported programming
languages to define reusable cloud components called `constructs`, which
are composed together into `stacks`, forming an "`Armkit` app".

They then use the [Armkit CLI](packages/armkit-cli) to interact with their `Armkit` app. The CLI allows developers to synthesize artifacts such as `Azure ARM Templates`, deploy `stacks` to development `Azure` accounts and `diff` against a deployed `stack` to understand the impact of a code change.

The [Armkit Construct Library](packages/@armkit/core) includes a module for each `Azure` service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of how to use Azure. The `Armkit` Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and glue-logic required when integrating various `Azure` services to achieve your goals on Azure.

Armkit packages:

* [@armkit/core](https://github.com/Yetics/armkit/tree/development/packages/%40armkit/core) - A library for defining `Azure` resources using programming `constructs`.
* [armkit-cli](https://github.com/Yetics/armkit/tree/development/packages/armkit-cli) - A CLI that allows users to run commands to initialize, import, and synthesize `Armkit` applications.

## Examples

Some sample `constructs` are in [examples](./examples/README.md). This could look like this:

### **`helloArmkit.ts`**

```ts
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, ArmStack } from '@armkit/core';
import {
  ContainerGroups, ContainerGroupPropertiesOsTypeEnum, MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsTypeEnum, MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsApiVersionEnum
} from './.generated/ContainerInstance'

export class HelloArmkit extends ArmStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    new ContainerGroups(this, 'MyContainerGroup', {
      name: 'azurecdktest',
      location: 'westeurope',
      apiVersion: MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsApiVersionEnum['2019_12_01'],
      type: MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsTypeEnum.MICROSOFT_CONTAINER_INSTANCE_CONTAINER_GROUPS,
      properties: {
        containers: [{
          name: 'ubuntu-server',
          properties: {
            image: 'ubuntu:18.04',
            command: ['sleep infinity'],
            resources: {
              requests: {
                cpu: 1,
                memoryInGB: 2
              },
              limits: {
                cpu: 1,
                memoryInGB: 2
              }
            }

          }
        }],
        osType: ContainerGroupPropertiesOsTypeEnum.LINUX,
      }
    })
  }
}

const app = new App({ outdir: 'cdk.out' });
new HelloArmkit(app, 'hello-armkit');
app.synth();
```
